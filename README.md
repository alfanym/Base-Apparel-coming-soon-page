### What I learned

Honestly the entire challenge was a mjor learning experience for me. I thought I knew the basics of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT and boy was I wrong. I have a very long way to go, but I am excited and proud of this challenge I have completed. I know its not perfect at all, but I have started it and attempted to complete it with the best of my knowledge and I didn't give up even though several times I almost did and I am proud of myself for that.

### Continued development

I want to continue my learning with Javascript. I am having the most trouble with this language and I am not comfortable at all yet, but I do not want to give up on it. Its a love/hate relationship with the language. It been quite some time since I have felt challenged with something and I'm grateful and excited with this journey so far. I also struggled with being able to add the linear gradient behind the background images. If anyone can help guide me to some resources so I can learn more regarding this topic I would appreciate it so much.
